  "content": "Answer: **NO**, you cannot get pregnant from just kissing. Pregnancy can only occur if sperm is ejaculated in or near the vagina. \r\n\r\nHow does pregnancy happen? 1) An egg (the female sex cell) must be released during ovulation, and 2) it must be fertilized by a sperm (the male sex cell).\r\n \r\nWhen a guy and a girl have unprotected vaginal sex, semen is released into the vagina. Semen is the white, sticky fluid that contains millions of sperm that comes out when a guy ejaculates. From there, the sperm then swims into the fallopian tubes. If the girl has recently ovulated (released an egg from one of her two ovaries), then the sperm can join with the egg. When the sperm and egg join, it is called fertilization.\r\n \r\nIf you want to know more about pregnancies, check out [LOCAL RESOURCE].\r\n\r\n**Next Question:**\r\n",
